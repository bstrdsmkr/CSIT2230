  <h1>The short version...</h1>
  <p>
        In 2012, I made contact with a group of like-minded hackers/makers/doers/crafters/builers and we
    founded <a href="http://www.knoxmakers.org">KnoxMakers.org</a>, East Tennessee's first Hackerspace. I served as a board member for the first
    year until work left me too far away to dedicate the appropriate amount of time to the position. KnoxMakers itself is a 501c3
    educational non-profit, formed with the purpose of furthering STEM education. We've fostered and enjoyed
    everything from blacksmithing to boat building and computer programming to electronic engineering.

        Now at 28, I've survived multiple years and positions in the industry including an on again/off again
    affair with private contracting. Currently, I am employeed full time as a DevOps Engineer in Oak Ridge
    National Lab's Information Technology Operations Center, as well as attending Pellissippi State full time
    in pursuit of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Programming. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about">See my full bio</a>

        For our first assignment, Dr. Brown asked us to create this portfolio page linking to our work throughout
    the semester. Each week, we'll update this list with a link to the new assignment.

          Since this isn't my first rodeo with HTML, I spent this week tooling up and sharpening the axe. I've
          been meaning to learn more about the Jekyll templating suite and this seemed like the perfect opportunity.
          Since the criteria of the assignment was to code an HTML page by hand, I'm linking to the hand-coded content
          of this page rather than back to the rendered page with header, footer, and etc.
