      <h3>Another heading</h3>
      <p>You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show
        .... You know? I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.</p>

      <p>I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.'
        Bull ... uh .... Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. Because ... look
        at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.</p>

      <p>I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .... Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't
        believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right? And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches:
        Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total surrender. But I dare anyone to debate me on things.</p>

      <p>You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .... (sighs) In fact, a lot of
        people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull ... uh .... It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement.
        You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. Because I'm just ... um .... I don't know. Why
        give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know?</p>

      <p>Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. Because I'm just ... um .... I don't know. Why give an interview
        when you can leave a warning, you know? You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro.</p>
